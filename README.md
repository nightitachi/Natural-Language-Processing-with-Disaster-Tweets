# 🌍📝 Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets 🚨🤖
Analyze and classify tweets to determine if they’re about real disasters or not! This project demonstrates two powerful approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🧠 and Machine Learning (ML) 🛠️, combining state-of-the-art deep learning with DistilBERT and traditional ML methods. 💬✨

📌 Project Overview
In this project, you'll find two implementations to classify tweets:

⚡ Deep Learning Approach
Model: Fine-tune the lightweight and efficient DistilBERT model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Preprocessing: Leverage the DistilBERT tokenizer for optimal tokenization and embedding generation.
⚙️ Traditional Machine Learning Approach
Model: Train an SGDClassifier from scikit-learn with TF-IDF vectorized features.
Preprocessing: Clean and process the text by removing noise, tokenizing, and lemmatizing.
🚀 Key Features
🗂️ Dataset
Tweets labeled as disaster-related or not, sourced from the Kaggle competition.
🧽 Preprocessing Pipeline
Remove noise (e.g., stopwords, punctuation, special characters).
Tokenize and lemmatize text for meaningful representation.
✍️ Vectorization
Deep Learning: Tokenize and generate embeddings using DistilBERT.
Traditional ML: Vectorize text using TF-IDF.
🔢 Model Training
Deep Learning: Fine-tune DistilBERT with a classifier head for binary classification.
Traditional ML: Train an SGDClassifier for efficient and scalable text classification.
📈 Evaluation
Analyze model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
