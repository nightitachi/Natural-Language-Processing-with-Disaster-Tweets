# 🌍📝 Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets 🚨🤖
Analyze and classify tweets to determine if they’re about real disasters or not! This project demonstrates two powerful approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🧠 and Machine Learning (ML) 🛠️, leveraging deep learning and traditional ML methods. 💬✨

📌 Project Overview
In this project, you'll find two implementations to classify tweets:
Deep Learning ⚡: Using Keras from TensorFlow.
Traditional Machine Learning ⚙️: Using SGDClassifier from scikit-learn.
🚀 Key Features
🗂️ Dataset: Tweets labeled as disaster-related or not, sourced from the Kaggle competition.
🧽 Preprocessing Pipeline:
Remove noise (stopwords, punctuation, special characters).
Tokenize and lemmatize the text for meaningful representation.
✍️ Vectorization:
Deep Learning: Word embeddings with TensorFlow/Keras.
Traditional ML: TF-IDF Vectorization with scikit-learn.
🔢 Model Training:
Deep Learning: Build a sequential neural network using Keras.
Traditional ML: Use a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier.
📈 Evaluation: Analyze model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
